  <h1>How to Play</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Your goal is to outscore the CPU by the end of the 4th quarter. Make strategic plays, avoid penalties, and drive down the field to score!</p>

    <h2>Game Flow</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each quarter lasts 10 minutes (game time).</li>
      <li>You can choose from four plays: Run, Pass, Field Goal, or Razzle Dazzle.</li>
      <li>Yardage gained or lost depends on your play type and RNG (random number generator).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Play Options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Run:</strong> Gain consistent yardage with lower risk. Beware of holding penalties and fumbles.</li>
      <li><strong>Pass:</strong> Potential for big gains, but higher risk of interceptions and incomplete passes.</li>
      <li><strong>Field Goal:</strong> Attempt to score 3 points if within range. Accuracy decreases with distance.</li>
      <li><strong>Razzle Dazzle:</strong> High-risk, high-reward play with unpredictable outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Penalties</h2>
    <p>Penalties occur randomly based on your play type or side. Common penalties include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Offside:</strong> Defense penalty, 5 yards added to your yard line.</li>
      <li><strong>Holding:</strong> Offense penalty, 10 yards subtracted.</li>
      <li><strong>Pass Interference:</strong> Defense penalty, 15 yards added.</li>
      <li><strong>Illegal Formation:</strong> Offense penalty, 5 yards and loss of down.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Injuries</h2>
    <p>If you use the same play type repeatedly, a player might get injured! Injuries disable the play for the rest of the drive. Use varied strategies to avoid this.</p>

    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
    <p>The game ends after the 4th quarter. Outscore the CPU to win. Good luck
